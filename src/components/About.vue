    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The Cedar River flows west from the Cascade Mountains in the state of Washington toward the city of Seattle.  The pristine water it carries is the original source for Cedar River Sake.</p>
    <p>Founded in August of 2012, Cedar River Brewing Company is the first sake brewery in Washington state in over 70 years.  We began brewing in the summer of 2013.</p>
    <p>We closed our Phinney Ridge brewery in November 2017. Brewery operations are currently on hiatus.</p>
